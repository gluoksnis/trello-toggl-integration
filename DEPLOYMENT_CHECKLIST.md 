# Deployment Checklist ‚úÖ

## Files to Upload to GitHub Pages

Upload these 4 files to your repository:

- [ ] Continue to Step 2

## Step 2: Upload Files

- [ ] Upload all 4 files to your GitHub repository
- [ ] Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy
- [ ] Test that files are accessible:
  - [ ] Visit `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/index.html`
  - [ ] Should load without errors

## Step 3: Create Trello Power-Up

- [ ] Go to https://trello.com/power-ups/admin
- [ ] Select your workspace
- [ ] Click "New"

  - [ ] **Iframe Connector URL**: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/index.html`
  - [ ] **Author**: Your name (optional)
  - [ ] **Support Contact**: Your email (optional)
- [ ] Click "Create"

## Step 4: Enable Capabilities

In the Power-Up admin:

- [ ] Go to "Capabilities" tab
- [ ] Enable these three:
  - [ ] `card-buttons`
  - [ ] `card-badges`
  - [ ] `show-settings`
- [ ] Click "Save"

## Step 5: Add to a Board

- [ ] Click "Save Configuration"
- [ ] Should see: "Settings saved for entire board!"

## Step 7: Test

- [ ] Open the same card
- [ ] Click "Start Timer"
- [ ] Should see: "Timer started successfully!"
- [ ] Open Toggl Track in another tab
- [ ] Verify timer is running with the card title

## Step 8: Test on Different Card

- [ ] Open a **different card** on the same board
- [ ] Click "Start Timer" (no setup needed!)
- [ ] Should work immediately
- [ ] Check Toggl - new timer with new card title

## Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:

### "Failed to fetch" error
- [ ] Did you enable CORS proxy access? (Step 1)
- [ ] Check browser console (F12) for detailed errors

### "Setup Toggl" button doesn't appear
- [ ] Hard refresh Trello (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- [ ] Check iframe connector URL is correct and ends with `/index.html`
- [ ] Verify all 4 files are uploaded to GitHub Pages

### "Card scope not available" error
- [ ] You're using old files - upload the new ones!
- [ ] Hard refresh Trello after uploading

### Power-Up doesn't show up
- [ ] Check you enabled it on the specific board
- [ ] Verify you're in the same workspace where you created the Power-Up
- [ ] Try disabling and re-enabling the Power-Up

### Timer doesn't appear in Toggl
- [ ] Check API token is correct (32 characters)
- [ ] Verify workspace ID is just numbers
- [ ] Look in Toggl Track ‚Üí Time Entries

## Success Criteria
